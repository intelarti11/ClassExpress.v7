# **App Name**: Bonjour Display

## Core Features:

- Text Display: Display the text 'Coucou' in a large, centered format on the webpage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of calmness and focus on the text. The design takes inspiration from the depth of twilight, aiming for clear communication with no distractions.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) to ensure high contrast and readability against the text.
- Accent color: Light blue (#7986CB) to add a subtle highlight without drawing too much attention from the primary content.
- Use a clear and highly readable font (such as Helvetica, Arial, or Open Sans) to maximize clarity and legibility. The focus is on ensuring that the displayed text is easily accessible and readable for all users.
- Center the text both vertically and horizontally to ensure it is the focal point of the page. Maximize its size as much as possible given various reasonable viewport sizes.
