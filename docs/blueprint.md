- Primary color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), almost indistinguishable from white to convey simplicity.
- Background color: Pure white (#FFFFFF) for a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft gray (#DDDDDD) to maintain a minimalist aesthetic and indicate selectable UI elements.
- Clean and simple sans-serif font to convey simplicity and legibility.
- Minimalist layout with the white page taking up the entire screen to provide an unobstructed view.
